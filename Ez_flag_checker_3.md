### Solution

In main._K, this is the part where it initializes a substitution box, which is also a key indicator of RC4 encryption.

This is where it scrambles that substitution box.

Back to main._mR4, as we know v11 stores the substitution box and v9 (might) stores the text that is going to be encrypted.
